WARNING:PhysDesignRules:774 - Unexpected DCM configuration. CLKOUT_PHASE_SHIFT
   is not configured VARIABLE for comp HDMI_Encoder0/DCM_TMDS_inst. The PSEN pin
   is connected to an active signal. The PSEN pin should be connected to GND to
   guarantee the expected operation.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.

      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   128 out of   3,758    3%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        68 out of   7,516    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          398
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           196 out of     398   49%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              46 out of  30,064    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
